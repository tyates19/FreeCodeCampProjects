# Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

## Example:

```javascript
const myVar = 5 + 10;
```
