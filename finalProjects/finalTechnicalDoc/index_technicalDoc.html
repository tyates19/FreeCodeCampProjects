            <p>
                This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web development 
                with all that they need to start coding websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you 
                from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start 
                making your way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other intermediate to 
                advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging — we will 
                hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn 
                the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning 
                web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class 
                materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web 
                technologies work.
            </p>

                <h3>Installing basic software</h3>
                    <li>
                        When it comes to tools for building a website, there's a lot to pick from. 
                        If you're just starting, you might be confused by the array of code editors, 
                        frameworks, and testing tools out there. In this article, we will show you 
                        step-by-step how to install the software you need to begin some basic web 
                        development.
                    </li>
                <h3>What will your website look like?</h3>
                    <li>
                        Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. 
                        What information are you showcasing? What fonts and colors are you using? 
                        Here we'll outline a simple method that you can follow to plan out your 
                        site's content and design.
                    </li>
                <h3>Dealing with files</h3>
                    <li>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media 
                        content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble 
                        these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one 
                        another. This article explains how to set up a sensible file structure for 
                        your website and what issues you should be aware of.
                    </li>
                <h3>HTML basics</h3>
                    <li>
                        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure 
                        your web content and give it meaning and purpose. For example, is my 
                        content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images 
                        inserted on my page? Do I have a data table? Without overwhelming you, 
                        this article will provide enough information to make you familiar with HTML.
                    </li>
                <h3>CSS basics</h3>
                    <li>
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. 
                        For example, do you want the text to be black or red? Where should content be 
                        drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to 
                        decorate your website? In this article, we'll take you through what you need 
                        to get started.
                    </li>
                <h3>JavaScript basics</h3>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive 
                        features to your website. Some examples could be games, things that happen 
                        when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, 
                        animation, and much more. In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is 
                        possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.
                    </li>
                <h3>Publishing your sample code</h3>
                    <li>
                        Once you have finished writing the code and organizing the files that make up 
                        your website, you need to put it all online so people can find it. This article 
                        describes how to get your simple sample code online with minimum effort.
                    </li>
                <h3>How the web works</h3>
                    <li>
                        When you access your favorite website, a lot of complicated things happen in 
                        the background that you may not know about. Here we will outline what happens 
                        when you view a webpage on your computer.

            <header>Getting our code examples</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all 
                    available on GitHub. If you want to copy them all to your computer, 
                    the easiest way is to download a ZIP of the latest master code branch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you prefer to copy the repo in a more flexible way that allows for 
                    automatic updates, you can follow the more complex instructions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Install Git on your machine. This is the underlying version control 
                        system software that GitHub works on top of.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open your computer's command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux, macOS).
                    </li>
                    <li>To copy the learning area repo to a folder called learning-area in the 
                        current location your command prompt/terminal is pointing to, use the 
                        following command:
                        <code>git clone https://github.com/mdn/learning-area</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can now enter the directory and find the files you are after (either 
                        using your Finder/File Explorer or the cd command).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You can update the learning-area repository with any changes made to the master 
                    version on GitHub with the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In your command prompt/terminal, go inside the learning-area directory 
                        using cd. For example, if you were in the parent directory:
                        <code>cd learning-area</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update the repository using the following command:
                        <code>git pull</code>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <header>Structure the world with HTML</header>
            <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology 
                used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether 
                your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, 
                image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or 
                even a new element that you define.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML">
            <header>What is HTML</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers 
                    how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple 
                    as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, 
                    which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make 
                    it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a 
                    hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, consider the following line of text:
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph 
                    by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="CSS_first_steps">
            <header>CSS first steps</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that 
                    we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different 
                    ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, 
                    however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing 
                    so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as 
                    styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere 
                    inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:
                    <code>
                        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
                    </code>
                <p>
                    This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, 
                    using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value 
                    of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule 
                    to styles.css.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:
                </p>
                    <code>h1 {
                        color: red;
                    }</code>
                <p>
                    Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The 
                    level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that 
                    happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an 
                    HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed 
                    everything correctly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions 
                    such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it 
                    do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience 
                    of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in 
                    detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.

            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to 
                implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does 
                more than just sit there and display static information for you to 
                look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 
                2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that 
                JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer 
                cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have 
                covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple 
                text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure 
                and purpose:
                <code>&lt;p&gt;Player 1: Chris&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>
                Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:
            </p>
                <code>p {
                        font-family: "helvetica neue", helvetica, sans-serif;
                        letter-spacing: 1px;
                        text-transform: uppercase;
                        text-align: center;
                        border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.6);
                        background: rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.3);
                        color: rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.6);
                        box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.4);
                        border-radius: 10px;
                        padding: 3px 10px;
                        display: inline-block;
                        cursor: pointer;
                }</code>
            <p>
                And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:
            </p>
                <code>const para = document.querySelector('p');
                para.addEventListener('click', updateName);

                function updateName() {
                    const name = prompt('Enter a new name');
                    para.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
                }</code>
            </p>
